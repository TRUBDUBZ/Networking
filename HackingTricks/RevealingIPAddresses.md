# Revealing IP Addresses 

- Misconfigured routers, firewalls, and network devices sometimes respond to network probes using nonpublic source addresses. You can use `tcpdump` used to  identify packets received from private addresses during testing.
  
- If you are behind a NAT of a Firewall these kind of packets are probably going to be filtered.
