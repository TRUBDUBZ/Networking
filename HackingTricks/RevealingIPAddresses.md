# Revealing IP Addresses 

  - Misconfigured routers, firewalls, and network devices sometimes respond to network probes using nonpublic source addresses. You can use *tcpdump* used to  identify packets received from private addresses during testing. In this case, the eth2 interface in Kali Linux is addressable from the public Internet (If you are behind a NAT of a Firewall this kind of packets are probably going to be filtered).
